## About
Welcome! This is my first JavaScript project. It simulates Yahtzee (my favourite dice game).

## Setup guide

If you just want to play the game online, head to [barbour-condini.github.io/yahtzee/](https://barbour-condini.github.io/yahtzee/) 

If you want to play offline or edit the game:

1. Fork the repo & open in your preferred IDE

2. Launch the index.html file

3. Enjoy, and if you spot some bugs, let me know!

## Roadmap
- Improve styling
