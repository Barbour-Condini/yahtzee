## About
Welcome! This is my first JavaScript project. It simulates Yahtzee (my favourite dice game).

## Setup guide

If you just want to play the game online, head to [barbour-condini.github.io/yahtzee/](https://barbour-condini.github.io/yahtzee/) 

If you want to download a copy of the game files to edit or play offline:

1. Fork and/or clone the repo; open in your preferred IDE
```
$ git clone https://github.com/Barbour-Condini/yahtzee.git 
```

2. Launch the index.html file

3. Enjoy, and if you spot some bugs, let me know!

## Roadmap
