## About
Welcome! This is my first JavaScript project. It simulates Yahtzee (my favourite dice game).

## Setup guide

1. Clone the repo; open in your preferred IDE
```
$ git clone https://github.com/Barbour-Condini/yahtzee.git 
```

2. Launch the index.html file

3. Enjoy, and if you spot some bugs, let me know!

## Roadmap
- Find a hosting platform for a MySQL database to score highscores along with player names.
